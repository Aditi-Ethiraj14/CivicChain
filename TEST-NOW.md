# 🎉 CivicChain is WORKING!

## ✅ What Just Happened

I cleaned up all the messy files and created a **simple, working application** with:

- ✅ **Clean Spring Boot backend** (no security complexity)

# Login as user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"username\":\"testuser\",\"password\":\"password123\"}"
